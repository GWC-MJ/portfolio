<h4>Skills</h4>
<ul>
<li> I am able to pay attention and listen when it comes to presentations or speeches.</li>
<li> I am also able to take an efficient amount of notes where one is able to understand without looking back.</li>
<li> Besides writing and listening I also enjoy art, whether it be ceramics, painting, drawing, cooking, or baking I am able to represent myself through any of these forms.</li>
<li> I am able to adapt myself to coding, eventhough I'm only a beginner I'm still able to understand the basics.</li>
<li> Apart from art I also play golf and hopefully in the next year I play for the swimming team for my school.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Goals</h5>
<ul>
  <li> In life, I hope to one day move the world with whatver I decide to take in life because currently I have no idea what kind of career I want to pursue.</li>
  <li> Besides finding the right career I also hope to continue my love for painting, drawing, and ceramics and get to know each of them better.</li>
  <li> Finally, I hope to one day go around the world to discover and explore new things since I've never been out of New York.</li>
</ul>
